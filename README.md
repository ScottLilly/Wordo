# Wordo
Interactive Twitch chat word-guessing game

This game is similar to "Wheel of Fortune".

A random word is selected from the appsettings.json file. The Twitch chatters guess what it is by selecting letters. If a letter is in the word, all those letters will be displayed. Players can also enter the whole word, if they think they know what it is. When a chatter guesses the word, or the last undiscovered letter, the win 10 points and the hidden letters for a new word are displayed.
